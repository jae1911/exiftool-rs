## Packages

 - [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/exiftool-rs-git)

## Usage

```
Jae Lo Presti
A small tool to scrub metadata from images.

USAGE:
    exiftool-rs [OPTIONS] <PATH>

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help       Print help information
    -V, --version    Print version information

SWITCHES:
    -i, --inplace    Do not change the image name

FILE:
    <PATH>    The image you want to apply the changes to
```

## Compiling

```
git clone https://github.com/jae1911/exiftool-rs
cd exiftool-rs
cargo build -r
```

The program will be then be available in `target/release/exiftool-rs`

## Benchmarks

Some benchmarks because everybody loves them.  
Everything was tested on a Ryzen 7 3700x with 32GB of ram.

Some events weren't counted. Try disabling the NMI watchdog:
    echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
    perf stat ...
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/nmi_watchdog
```

As you can see, `exiftool-rs` is faster than `mat2` and `exiftool` (Perl) according to this very professional benchmark.  
Sample EXIF file was taken from [ianare/exif-samples](https://github.com/ianare/exif-samples/blob/master/jpg/gps/DSCN0010.jpg).
